# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

The main page has a sticky Nav bar, and there are 3 APIs that were used. There is a book section, where there is a search bar, and on typing the name, in the drop down, all the bpoks having that name are displayed. When any one is selected, it will give the cover of that book, and details of it, and if there is a Buy Now Option, when clicked, will take the user to the Google Play Store, where the payment can be made and but the book.
In the jokes and trivia sections, jokes are just displayed and in the Trivia section, when clicked on the Reveal answer, the answer is displayed as an alert. Load Next, will give the next one.
